The American Life focuses on a first-person perspective as an international student who have been living in Tucson. My work investigates the blend of American and Asian cultures. There is a saying in my country: “To be unified but not dissolved” which means to be able to adapt to the lifestyle but still preserve the original root of themselves. Through these series of photographs, I want to offer the audience a standpoint, an eye from the outside to be able to look back at how everyone in a way is related and connected. After all, my photographs are my way of expressing many different international students experience while living in the United States as a stranger to culture, to learns their way to reorganize oneself and to be Americanized and maintain their traditional values.
