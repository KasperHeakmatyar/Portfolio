In Cactus Lands, I address this topic through intuitive searches, although some have arrived without looking for them. I experiment with the poetic of the thorny and the deteriorated. I experiment with the tonal range and with the decontextualization of objects. By summing symbols from the initial symbols, I superimpose the images, give them other readings, and abstract them from their context. Transcripts of the narrative woven by their nature, telling in detail their way of being and existing.
